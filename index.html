        Medlora, was established in March 2022 with a purpose to deliver quality
        medicine to people who do not want to be hassled on going to a pharmacy.
        Mr. Quijote, Mr. Delos Reyes, Mr. Giron, Mr. Gadiane, Ms. Norella and
        Mr. Camat are entrepreneurs who want to develop an application to those
        people who don’t want to go to pharmacy. Developers enter
        entrepreneurship to learn more knowledge about businesses and to enhance
        their programming skill by developing an app
      </p>

        Our company name comes from the word “Medicine and Zalora” which is a
        major ecommerce site in the Philippines. We combined the word Medicine
        and Zalora that became Medlora. The name of our company made us realize
        that we can give out or deliver medicine without the hassle of our
        consumer going out. Our company logo states the cross logo as to
        symbolize health and we put our tagline which is “Best Medicine, Best
        Price” for our future consumer to know what we can give our services. We
        also used white background to serve as cleanliness as we deliver out the
        products that our consumer bought.
